# Twitch Clips to TikTok Uploader with Discord Bot

This project allows you to convert Twitch clips into TikTok-ready vertical videos and automaticly upload it to your TikTok profile using a Discord bot. Just drop a Twitch clip URL in the bot's DMs, and it will process and upload the video with hashtags based on your selected layout: fullscreen or webcam mode.

---

**Layout Selection**
  - `fullscreen` — centers the full 16:9 clip in a vertical 9:16 canvas with `template.png` around it
  - `webcam` — detects and crops webcam feed using face detection
